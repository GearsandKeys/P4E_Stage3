# Assignment
Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

first, open payCalculator.py

Starter Code
# This first line is provided for you

```python
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
```

## Desired Output
```python
Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 10
Pay: 475.0
```

## How to test
Run pytest. You want 2/4 tests to pass. The next two tests are for the next assignment!

# Optional Assignment
After finishing the first assignment, rewrite your pay program using try and except.
This way your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. 

## Desired Output
The following shows two executions of the program:

```python
Enter Hours: 20
Enter Rate: nine
Error, please enter numeric input
Enter Hours: forty
Error, please enter numeric input
```

## How to Test
Run Pytest.

You should now have 4/4 passing tests!
